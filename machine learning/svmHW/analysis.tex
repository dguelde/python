\indent The Sklearn implementation of SVM was used to differentiate between 3's and 8's in the MNIST data set.  In an effort to get the highest accuracy, I implemented the linear, poly, and rbf kernel, each with a range of C values.\\

\indent The poly kernel began to produce high accuracy with relatively small C values, even as low as $C = 2$, but maximum accuracy of 0.9929 was achieved on a test set at $C = 2048$.\\
\indent The rbf kernel produced accuracy of over .97 for all $C \geq 1$.  Where $C < 1$, accuracy drops drastically as $C$ approaches 0.  Maximum accuracy on the test set was 0.9914 at $C = 448$.\\
\indent The linear kernel produces reliably high accuracy for seemingly all C values, but never reaches the very high $(>.99)$ accuracy of the other two kernels.  This suggests that the data is nearly linearly seperable, with a handful of outliers.  Maximum accuracy for the linear kernel on the test set was 0.9698, with $C = 0.01$.  However, accuracy never dropped below .95 for any value of C.\\
