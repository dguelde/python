['Vast and starless the pall of heaven', 'Laps on the trailing pall below', 'And forward forward in solemn darkness', 'As if to the sea of the lost we go', 'Now drawn nigh the edge of the river', 'Weirdlike creatures suddenly rise', 'Shapes that fade dissolving outlines', 'Baffle the gazers straining eyes', 'Towering upward and bending forward', 'Wild and wide their arms are thrown', 'Ready to pierce with forked fingers', 'Him who touches their realm upon', 'Tide of youth thus thickly planted', 'While in the eddies onward you swim', 'Thus on the shore stands a phantom army', 'Lining forever the channels rim', 'Steady helmsman you guide the immortal', 'Many a wreck is beneath you piled', 'Many a brave yet unwary sailor', 'Over these waters has been beguiled', 'Nor is it the storm or the scowling midnight', 'Cold or sickness or fires dismay', 'Nor is it the reef or treacherous quicksand', 'Will peril you most on your twisted way', 'But when there comes a voluptuous languor', 'Soft the sunshine silent the air', 'Bewitching your craft with safety and sweetness', 'Then young pilot of life beware']
