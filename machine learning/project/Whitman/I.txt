['Of olden time when it came to pass', 'That the beautiful god Jesus should finish his work on earth', 'Then went Judas and sold the divine youth', 'And took pay for his body', 'Cursd was the deed even before the sweat of the clutching hand', 'grew dry', 'And darkness frownd upon the seller of the like of God', 'Where as though earth lifted her breast to throw him from her', 'and heaven refused him', 'He hung in the air selfslaughterd', 'The cycles with their long shadows have stalkd silently forward', 'Since those ancient daysmany a pouch enwrapping meanwhile', 'Its fee like that paid for the son of Mary', 'And still goes one saying', 'What will ye give me and I will deliver this man unto you', 'And they make the covenant and pay the pieces of silver']
