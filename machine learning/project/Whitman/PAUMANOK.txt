violence and severe', 'chastisement that such things made but little interruption in the tenor', 'of their way', 'Now while the intervening hour is passing we will clear up the mystery', 'of the bag and of young Barker being under the garden fence on the', 'preceding night The boys mother was a widow and they both had to live', 'in the very narrowest limits His father had died when he was six years', 'old and little Tim was left a sickly emaciated infant whom no one', 'expected to live many months To the surprise of all however the poor', 'child kept alive and seemd to recover his health as he certainly', 'did his size and good looks This was owing to the kind offices of an', 'eminent physician who had a countryseat in the neighborhood and who', 'had been interested in the widows little family Tim the physician', 'said might possibly outgrow his disease but everything was uncertain', 'It was a mysterious and baffling malady and it would not be wonderful', 'if he should in some moment of apparent health be suddenly taken away', 'The poor widow was at first in a continual state of uneasiness but', 'several years had now passd and none of the impending evils had fallen', 'upon the boys head His mother seemd to feel confident that he would', 'live and be a help and an honor to her old age and the two struggled', 'on together mutually happy in each other and enduring much of poverty', 'and discomfort without repining each for the others sake', 'Tims pleasant disposition had made him many friends in the village and', 'among the rest a young fanner named Jones who with his elder brother', 'workd a large farm in the neighborhood on shares Jones very frequently', 'made Tim a present of a bag of potatoes or corn or some garden', 'vegetables which he took from his own stock but as his partner was a', 'parsimonious hightempered man and had often said that Tim was an', 'idle fellow and ought not to be helpd because he did not work Jones', 'generally made his gifts in such a manner that no one knew anything', 'about them except himself and the grateful objects of his kindness', 'It might be too that the widow was both to have it understood by the', 'neighbors that she received food from anyone for there is often an', 'excusable pride in people of her condition which makes them shrink from', 'being considerd as objects of charity as they would from the severest', 'pains On the night in question Tim had been told that Jones would send', 'them a bag of potatoes and the place at which they were to be waiting', 'for him was fixed at Mr Nicholss gardenfence It was this bag that', 'Tim had been seen staggering under and which caused the unlucky boy to', 'be accused and convicted by his teacher as a thief That teacher was one', 'little fitted for his important and responsible office Hasty to decide', 'and inflexibly severe he was the terror of the little world he ruled', 'so despotically Punishment he seemed to delight in Knowing little of', 'those sweet fountains which in childrens breasts ever open quickly', 'at the call of gentleness and kind words he was feard by all for his', 'sternness and loved by none I would that he were an isolated instance', 'in his profession', 'The hour of grace had drawn to its close and the time approachd at', 'which it was usual for Lugare to give his school a joyfullyreceivd', 'dismission Now and then one of the scholars would direct a furtive', 'glance at Tim sometimes in pity sometimes in indifference or inquiry', 'They knew that he would have no mercy shown him and though most of them', 'loved him whipping was too common there to exact much sympathy Every', 'inquiring glance however remaind unsatisfied for at the end of the', 'hour Tim remaind with his face completely hidden and his head bowd', 'in his arms precisely as he had leand himself when he first went', 'to his seat Lugare lookd at the boy occasionally with a scowl which', 'seemd to bode vengeance for his sullenness At length the last class', 'had been heard and the last lesson recited and Lugare seated himself', 'behind his desk on the platform with his longest and stoutest ratan', 'before him', 'Now Barker he said well settle that little business of yours', 'Just step up here', 'Tim did not move The schoolroom was as still as the grave Not a sound', 'was to be heard except occasionally a longdrawn breath', 'Mind me sir or it will be the worse for you Step up here and take', 'off your jacket', 'The boy did not stir any more than if he had been of wood Lugare shook', 'with passion He sat still a minute as if considering the best way to', 'wreak his vengeance That minute passed in deathlike silence was', 'a fearful one to some of the children for their faces whitend with', 'fright It seemd as it slowly droppd away like the minute which', 'precedes the climax of an exquisitelyperformed tragedy when some', 'mighty master of the histrionic art is treading the stage and you', 'and the multitude around you are waiting with stretchd nerves and', 'suspended breath in expectation of the terrible catastrophe', 'Tim is asleep sir at length said one of the boys who sat near him', 'Lugare at this intelligence allowd his features to relax from their', 'expression of savage anger into a smile but that smile lookd more', 'malignant if possible than his former scowls It might be that he felt', 'amused at the horror depicted on the faces of those about him or', 'it might be that he was gloating in pleasure on the way in which he', 'intended to wake the slumberer', 'Asleep are you my young gentleman said he let us see if we cant', 'find something to tickle your eyes open Theres nothing like making the', 'best of a bad case boys Tim here is determind not to be worried in', 'his mind about a little flogging for the thought of it cant even keep', 'the little scoundrel awake', 'Lugare smiled again as he made the last observation He graspd his', 'ratan firmly and descended from his seat With light and stealthy steps', 'he crossd the room and stood by the unlucky sleeper The boy was still', 'as unconscious of his impending punishment as ever He might be dreaming', 'some golden dream of youth and pleasure perhaps he was far away in the', 'world of fancy seeing scenes and feeling delights which cold reality', 'never can bestow Lugare lifted his ratan high over his head and with', 'the true and expert aim which he had acquired by long practice brought', 'it down on Tims back with a force and whacking sound which seemd', 'sufficient to wake a freezing man in his last lethargy Quick and fast', 'blow foliowd blow Without waiting to see the effect of the first cut', 'the brutal wretch plied his instrument of torture first on one side of', 'the boys back and then on the other and only stopped at the end of', 'two or three minutes from very weariness But still Tim showd no signs', 'of motion and as Lugare provoked at his torpidity jerkd away one of', 'the childs arms on which he had been leaning over the desk his head', 'droppd down on the board with a dull sound and his face lay turnd up', 'and exposed to view When Lugare saw it he stood like one transfixd', 'by a basilisk His countenance turnd to a leaden whiteness the ratan', 'droppd from his grasp and his eyes stretchd wide open glared as at', 'some monstrous spectacle of horror and death The sweat started in', 'great globules seemingly from every pore in his face his skinny lips', 'contracted and showd his teeth and when he at length stretchd forth', 'his arm and with the end of one of his fingers touchd the childs', 'cheek each limb quiverd like the tongue of a snake and his strength', 'seemed as though it would momentarily fail him The boy was dead He', 'had probably been so for some time for his eyes were turnd up and his', 'body was quite cold Death was in the schoolroom and Lugare had been', 'flogging A CORPSE', 'Democratic Review August 1841']
