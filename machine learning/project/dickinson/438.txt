['If I may have it when its dead', 'I will contented be', 'If just as soon as breath is out', 'It shall belong to me', 'Until they lock it in the grave', 'T is bliss I cannot weigh', 'For though they lock thee in the grave', 'Myself can hold the key', 'Think of it lover I and thee', 'Permitted face to face to be', 'After a life a death well say ', 'For death was that and this is thee']
