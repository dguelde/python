['Our journey had advanced', 'Our feet were almost come', 'To that odd fork in Beings road', 'Eternity by term', 'Our pace took sudden awe', 'Our feet reluctant led', 'Before were cities but between', 'The forest of the dead', 'Retreat was out of hope ', 'Behind a sealed route', 'Eternitys white flag before', 'And God at every gate']
