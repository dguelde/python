['We like March his shoes are purple', 'He is new and high', 'Makes he mud for dog and peddler', 'Makes he forest dry', 'Knows the adders tongue his coming', 'And begets her spot', 'Stands the sun so close and mighty', 'That our minds are hot', 'News is he of all the others', 'Bold it were to die', 'With the bluebirds buccaneering', 'On his British sky']
