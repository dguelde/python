['It tossed and tossed ', 'A little brig I knew ', 'Oertook by blast', 'It spun and spun', 'And groped delirious for morn', 'It slipped and slipped', 'As one that drunken stepped', 'Its white foot tripped', 'Then dropped from sight', 'Ah brig goodnight', 'To crew and you', 'The oceans heart too smooth too blue', 'To break for you']
