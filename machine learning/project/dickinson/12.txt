['The soul selects her own society', 'Then shuts the door', 'On her divine majority', 'Obtrude no more', 'Unmoved she notes the chariots pausing', 'At her low gate', 'Unmoved an emperor is kneeling', 'Upon her mat', 'Ive known her from an ample nation', 'Choose one', 'Then close the valves of her attention', 'Like stone']
